## ⚡ 30-Second Client Demo & Persona Switcher

The application features an instant **1-Click Demo Persona Bar** on `/login` and a persistent top-tier demo switcher, allowing prospective clients and technical leads to evaluate the platform across all three core commercial roles with zero signup friction:

| Persona | Role | Email | Password | Key Capabilities Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sara Hassan** | **Collector Patron** (Customer) | `sara@example.com` | `Demo1234!` | Browse catalog, choose product variants, slide-over mini cart, promo codes, 3-step checkout, Paymob credit card vault (3D-Secure), visual delivery tracking, PDF invoices. |
| **Layla Al-Rashidi** | **Artisan Seller** (Multi-Vendor Studio) | `layla@ateliermarket.com` | `Demo1234!` | Studio KPI dashboard, catalog pieces CRUD with stock thresholds, order status progression (`crafting`, `shipped`, Aramex tracking numbers). |
| **Admin Director** | **Platform Admin** (Director) | `admin@ateliermarket.com` | `Demo1234!` | Marketplace-wide GMV analytics, cross-platform orders monitor, artisan directory, cross-studio piece audit, system health. |

> **Demo Mode Notice**: Instant demo personas and automatic account bootstrapping/resets are active when `DEMO_MODE=true` is set in the environment (configured in Vercel project settings for live showcase evaluations). In standard production or non-demo environments where `DEMO_MODE` is unset or `false`, demo bootstrapping and credential resets are disabled to safeguard production data.

## 💎 Core Commercial & Engineering Features

### 1. Slide-Over Mini Cart Drawer & Conversion-Rate Optimization (CRO)
* **Slide-Over Cart Drawer**: Adding pieces smoothly slides open a luxury mini bag drawer from the side, providing immediate item feedback without navigating away from the browsing flow.
* **Instant Quantity Stepper Manipulation**: Collectors can adjust quantities, select custom options, view subtotal updates in real time, and click "Proceed to Checkout" directly.
* **Regional Free Shipping Progress Meter**: An animated gold-leaf meter calculates distance to the **$150 USD** free delivery threshold (*"Add $XX.XX more to unlock Complimentary Express Courier!"*), transitioning into a celebratory unlocked badge upon qualification.
* **Mobile Sticky "Add to Bag" Bottom Sheet**: Built with `IntersectionObserver`, detecting when the primary CTA scrolls past the mobile viewport to present a compact fixed purchase sheet with piece thumbnail, active variant, live price, and an instant CTA button.

### 2. Multi-Role RBAC & Centralized Platform Administration
* **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict multi-tenant authorization separating Patron Customers, Artisan Sellers, and Platform Administrators.
* **Platform Analytics Suite (`/admin/dashboard`)**: Aggregates Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), total marketplace orders, active pieces count, top-performing artisan studios, and recent cross-seller transactions.
* **Marketplace Orders Audit (`/admin/orders`)**: Real-time cross-vendor order inspection drawer with collector dossiers, studio breakdowns, tracking links, and PDF invoice generation.
* **Artisans Directory (`/admin/artisans`)**: Directory of verified studios across the Gulf & Levant with regional badges, joined dates, and catalog piece audits.

### 3. Inventory Protection & Out-of-Stock Engine
* **Atomic Stock Decrements**: Inventory validation on `/api/cart` and atomic decrement (`$inc: { stock: -quantity }`) on `/api/orders` to prevent over-selling and race conditions.
* **Dynamic Scarcity Signals**: Amber urgency badges (*"Only X left in studio"*) displayed when stock drops below threshold (`lowStockThreshold <= 5`), with automated *"Sold Out"* state, disabled CTAs, and archival grayscale imagery when depleted.

### 4. Visual Order Lifecycle & Delivery Tracker
* **Multi-Stage Delivery Stepper**: Visual 4-stage tracking flow (`01 CONFIRMED` ➔ `02 IN STUDIO` ➔ `03 DISPATCHED` ➔ `04 DELIVERED`).
* **Studio Provenance Timeline**: Chronological event logs with timestamps, carrier tracking codes (e.g., Aramex White-Glove Courier), and milestone notes appended directly by the crafting artisan.
* **1-Click Tracking Copy**: Instant clipboard copy with animated visual feedback.

### 5. Enterprise Product Variants Schema
* **Flexible Multi-SKU Architecture**: Products support custom dimensions (volumes, framing options, scent profiles) with distinct SKUs, individual stock levels, compare-at pricing, and separate cart line-item serialization.
* **Interactive Variant Pill Selector**: Luxury pill UI with dynamic pricing, compare-at discounts, and real-time inventory checks.

### 6. Interactive Leaflet Geolocation Studio Mapping
* **Artisan Atlas (`/map`)**: Interactive Leaflet/OpenStreetMap interface mapping heritage workshops in Riyadh, Damascus, Beirut, Cairo, and Muscat.
* **Contextual Geocoding**: Direct links between catalog piece pages and geographic workshop origins.

### 7. Memory-Efficient PDF Invoice Streaming
* **Dynamic Buffer Streaming**: Official archival PDF invoices generated on-the-fly using `pdfkit` and piped directly to the response stream without lingering disk storage.

### 8. Production Hardening, SEO & Security
* **Schema.org Structured Data**: Automatic injection of `<script type="application/ld+json">` for Google Product Rich Snippets (pricing, availability, aggregate rating).
* **Social Sharing Previews**: OpenGraph and Twitter Card meta tags configured for high-fidelity previews on Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp.
* **Rate Limiting & Cryptographic Cookies**: `express-rate-limit` deployed on authentication gateways; sessions signed with cryptographically secure 256-bit secrets via `crypto.randomBytes`.
* **Cross-Platform Test Reliability**: Vitest configuration hardened with `fileParallelism: false` to eliminate database port collisions across Windows, macOS, and Linux CI.

### 9. Paymob Payment Gateway Integration & Luxury Vault
* **Complete Financial Pipeline**: Seamlessly implements the 3-step Paymob financial workflow — Ephemeral Auth Token generation, Order Registration in piasters (cents), Payment Key Token issuance, and Bank 3D-Secure (3DS) ACS authorization.
* **Atelier Noir Luxury Payment Vault**: Custom high-fidelity modal dialog featuring real-time Luhn algorithm card validation, live brand detection (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), and dynamic interactive card preview matching luxury direct-to-consumer standards.
* **Dual Execution Rails**: Direct card API submission with smooth bank OTP challenge redirection, alongside an instant toggle to inspect the official Paymob hosted iframe container.
* **HMAC-SHA512 Cryptographic Webhook Security**: Server-to-server webhook endpoint (`POST /api/paymob/webhook`) cryptographically verified against Paymob's 20-field lexical ordering signature to prevent man-in-the-middle or price-tampering attacks.
* **Fail-Safe Browser Return & Active Reconciliation**: Dynamic redirection callback (`ALL /api/paymob/callback`) supporting cross-environment URL resolution with celebratory status banners. Active transaction inquiry (`inquirePaymobOrder`) reconciles unconfirmed orders and empties carts even if a customer uses browser back buttons.
* **Strict RTL/LTR Isolation**: Dedicated bidirectional layout isolation ensuring card numbers, expiry dates, and CVVs preserve proper cursor tracking and numerical formatting under Arabic RTL mode.

### 10. Service-Oriented Architecture, Clean Code & Automated CI (Phase 8 Refactoring)
* **Decoupled Domain Service Layer**: Extracted core business logic out of controllers into dedicated, testable domain services (`services/authService.js`, `services/productService.js`, `services/cartService.js`, `services/orderService.js`, `services/adminService.js`, `services/paymobService.js`). Controllers now strictly serve as thin HTTP adapters validating requests and formatting JSON responses.
* **Controller Modularization & Facade Pattern**: Monolithic `controllers/shop.js` (23.8KB) decomposed into single-responsibility domain controllers (`controllers/products.js`, `controllers/cart.js`, `controllers/orders.js`), with `controllers/shop.js` acting as a backward-compatible facade.
* **Async/Await Uniformity**: Refactored asynchronous flows across the backend to eliminate mixed `.then()/.catch()` promise chains in favor of clean `async/await` and standardized `next(err)` error handling.
* **Automated Multi-Version CI Matrix**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) running parallel matrix builds across Node.js `20.x` and `22.x` on `ubuntu-latest`. Enforces deterministic `npm ci`, in-memory MongoDB backend integration tests, client component tests, TypeScript strict checks (`tsc -b`), and Vite production bundle builds with auto-cancellation for superseded runs.
* **Hardened Demo Bootstrap & Minimal Sessions**: Demo persona bootstrapping and password resets are strictly gated behind `DEMO_MODE=true` environment guards. Session storage was audited and minimized from entire Mongoose documents to sanitized `{ _id, role }` tokens to eliminate credential leakage.
* **Bootstrap & Seeding Decoupling**: Streamlined `server.js` from 35.6KB down to a lean ~65-line bootstrap entry point with graceful shutdown handling (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`), extracting all seed identities, catalogs, reviews, and migration backfills into `scripts/seedDemoData.js`.
* **Hybrid Token-Driven Tailwind Architecture**: Codified single source of truth in `client/src/design-system/tokens.css`, dynamically bound to `client/tailwind.config.ts` via RGB color channels (`rgb(var(--color-*-rgb) / <alpha-value>)`) to deliver dynamic alpha transparency, high-contrast dark mode switching, and 100% token consistency across 1,800+ JSX utility classes.
* **Dependency & Workspace Pruning**: Purged 70+ legacy transitive packages by eliminating unused SQL connectors (`mysql2`, `sequelize`) and server-side template engines (`pug`, `ejs`, `express-handlebars`). Cleaned obsolete root media and static disk invoice PDFs in favor of dynamic in-memory buffer streaming.
